This document is a fork of what seems to be a standard ruby and rails style
guide in the  community, modified for how things are done at TeamPages.com.

# The Ruby Style Guide

This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby
programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby
programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all &ndash; no matter how good it is.

## Source Code Layout

> Nearly everybody is convinced that every style but their own is
> ugly and unreadable. Leave out the "but their own" and they're
> probably right... <br/>
> -- Jerry Coffin (on indentation)

* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.
* Use two **spaces** per indentation level.

    ```Ruby
    # good
    def some_method
      do_something
    end

    # bad - four spaces
    def some_method
        do_something
    end
    ```

* Use Unix-style line endings. (*BSD/Solaris/Linux/OSX users are covered by default,
  Windows users have to be extra careful.)
    * If you're using Git you might want to add the following
    configuration setting to protect your project from Windows line
    endings creeping in:

        ```$ git config --global core.autocrlf true```

* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around `{`
  and before `}`. Whitespace might be (mostly) irrelevant to the Ruby
  interpreter, but its proper use is the key to writing easily
  readable code.

    ```Ruby
    sum = 1 + 2
    a, b = 1, 2
    1 > 2 ? true : false; puts 'Hi'
    [1, 2, 3].each { |e| puts e }
    ```

    The only exception is when using the exponent operator:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    e = M * c ** 2

    # good
    e = M * c**2
    ```

* Spaces should be used after `(`, `[` and before `]`, `)`.

    ```Ruby
    some( arg ).other
    [ 1, 2, 3 ].length
    def( blah = nil )
    end
    ```

* Indent `when` as deep as `case`.

    ```Ruby
    case
    when song.name == 'Misty'
      puts 'Not again!'
    when song.duration > 120
      puts 'Too long!'
    when Time.now.hour > 21
      puts "It's too late"
    else
      song.play
    end

    kind = case year
           when 1850..1889 then 'Blues'
           when 1890..1909 then 'Ragtime'
           when 1910..1929 then 'New Orleans Jazz'
           when 1930..1939 then 'Swing'
           when 1940..1950 then 'Bebop'
           else 'Jazz'
           end
    ```

* Use empty lines between `def`s and to break up a method into logical
  paragraphs.

    ```Ruby
    def some_method
      data = initialize(options)

      data.manipulate!

      data.result
    end

    def some_method
      result
    end
    ```
* Add comment lines above all method declarations
    ```Ruby
    # -------------------------------------------------------------- some_method
    def some_method
    end
    # ------------------------------------------------------------- other_method
    def other_method( a, b, c )
    end
    ```

* Align the parameters of a method call if they span over multiple lines.

    ```Ruby
    # starting point (line is too long)
    def send_mail( source )
      Mailer.deliver( to: 'bob@example.com', from: 'us@example.com', subject: 'Important message', body: source.text )
    end

    # bad (normal indent)
    def send_mail( source )
      Mailer.deliver(
        to: 'bob@example.com',
        from: 'us@example.com',
        subject: 'Important message',
        body: source.text )
    end

    # bad (double indent)
    def send_mail( source )
      Mailer.deliver(
          to: 'bob@example.com',
          from: 'us@example.com',
          subject: 'Important message',
          body: source.text )
    end

    # good
    def send_mail( source )
      Mailer.deliver( to: 'bob@example.com',
                      from: 'us@example.com',
                      subject: 'Important message',
                      body: source.text )
    end
    ```

* Use RDoc and its conventions for API documentation.  Don't put an
  empty line between the comment block and the `def`.
* Keep lines fewer than 80 characters.
* Avoid trailing whitespace.

## Syntax

* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments. Omit the
  parentheses when the method doesn't accept any arguments.

     ```Ruby
     def some_method
       # body omitted
     end

     def some_method_with_arguments( arg1, arg2 )
       # body omitted
     end
     ```

* Never use `for`, unless you know exactly why. Most of the time iterators
  should be used instead. `for` is implemented in terms of `each` (so
  you're adding a level of indirection), but with a twist - `for`
  doesn't introduce a new scope (unlike `each`) and variables defined
  in its block will be visible outside it.

    ```Ruby
    arr = [ 1, 2, 3 ]

    # bad
    for elem in arr do
      puts elem
    end

    # good
    arr.each { |elem| puts elem }
    ```

* Never use `then` for multi-line `if/unless`.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if some_condition then
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if some_condition
      # body omitted
    end
    ```

* Favor the ternary operator(`?:`) over short `if/then/else/end` constructs.  Do
  not use single line if bool then ... else ... end statements.  Trailing ifs 
  are acceptable for flow coontrol.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = if some_condition then something else something_else end

    # good
    result = some_condition ? something : something_else

    # good
    next if condition_true
    ```

* Use one expression per branch in a ternary operator. This
  also means that ternary operators must not be nested. Prefer
  `if/else` constructs in these cases.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    some_condition ? (nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else) : something_else

    # good
    if some_condition
      nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else
    else
      something_else
    end
    ```

* Never use `if x: ...` - it is removed in Ruby 1.9. Use
  the ternary operator instead.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = if some_condition: something else something_else end

    # good
    result = some_condition ? something : something_else
    ```

* Never use `if x; ...`. Use the ternary operator instead.

* Use `when x then ...` for one-line cases. The alternative syntax
  `when x: ...` is removed in Ruby 1.9.

* Never use `when x; ...`. See the previous rule.

* Use `&&/||` for boolean expressions, `and/or` for control flow.  (Rule
  of thumb: If you have to use outer parentheses, you are using the
  wrong operators.)

    ```Ruby
    # boolean expression
    if some_condition && some_other_condition
      do_something
    end

    # control flow
    document.saved? or document.save!
    ```

* Avoid multi-line `?:` (the ternary operator), use `if/unless` instead.

* Favor modifier `if/unless` usage when you have a single-line
  body. Another good alternative is the usage of control flow `and/or`.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if some_condition
      do_something
    end

    # good
    do_something if some_condition

    # another good option
    some_condition and do_something
    ```

* Favor `if` over `unless` at all times.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    do_something unless some_condition

    # good
    do_something if !some_condition

    # another good option
    some_condition or do_something
    ```

* Never use `unless` with `else`. Rewrite these with the positive case first.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    unless success?
      puts 'failure'
    else
      puts 'success'
    end

    # good
    if success?
      puts 'success'
    else
      puts 'failure'
    end
    ```

* Don't use parentheses around the condition of an `if/unless/while`,
  unless the condition contains an assignment (see "Using the return
  value of `=`" below).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    if ( x > 10 )
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if x > 10
      # body omitted
    end

    # ok
    if ( x = self.next_value )
      # body omitted
    end
    ```

* Favor modifier `while/until` usage when you have a single-line
  body.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    while some_condition
      do_something
    end

    # good
    do_something while some_condition
    ```

* Favor `until` over `while` for negative conditions.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    do_something while !some_condition

    # good
    do_something until some_condition
    ```

* Omit parentheses around parameters for methods that are part of an
  internal DSL (e.g. Rake, Rails, RSpec), methods that are with
  "keyword" status in Ruby (e.g. `attr_reader`, `puts`) and attribute
  access methods. Use parentheses around the arguments of all other
  method invocations.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      attr_reader :name, :age

      # omitted
    end

    temperance = Person.new( 'Temperance', 30 )
    temperance.name

    puts temperance.age

    x = Math.sin( y )
    array.delete( e )
    ```

* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end` for single-line blocks.  Avoid using
  `{...}` for multi-line blocks (multiline chaining is always
  ugly). Always use `do...end` for "control flow" and "method
  definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles and certain DSLs).  Avoid `do...end`
  when chaining.

    ```Ruby
    names = ['Bozhidar', 'Steve', 'Sarah']

    # good
    names.each { |name| puts name }

    # bad
    names.each do |name|
      puts name
    end

    # good
    names.select { |name| name.start_with?('S') }.map { |name| name.upcase }

    # bad
    names.select do |name|
      name.start_with?('S')
    end.map { |name| name.upcase }
    ```

    Some will argue that multiline chaining would look OK with the use of {...}, but they should
    ask themselves - it this code really readable and can't the blocks contents be extracted into
    nifty methods.

* Avoid `return` where not required.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def some_method(some_arr)
      return some_arr.size
    end

    # good
    def some_method(some_arr)
      some_arr.size
    end
    ```

* Avoid `self` where not required.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def ready?
      if self.last_reviewed_at > self.last_updated_at
        self.worker.update(self.content, self.options)
        self.status = :in_progress
      end
      self.status == :verified
    end

    # good
    def ready?
      if last_reviewed_at > last_updated_at
        worker.update(content, options)
        self.status = :in_progress
      end
      status == :verified
    end
    ```

* As a corollary, avoid shadowing methods with local variables unless they are both equivalent

    ```Ruby
    class Foo
      attr_accessor :options

      # ok
      def initialize(options)
        self.options = options
        # both options and self.options are equivalent here
      end

      # bad
      def do_something(options = {})
        unless options[:when] == :later
          output(self.options[:message])
        end
      end

      # good
      def do_something(params = {})
        unless params[:when] == :later
          output(options[:message])
        end
      end
    end

* Use spaces around the `=` operator when assigning default values to method parameters:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def some_method(arg1=:default, arg2=nil, arg3=[])
      # do something...
    end

    # good
    def some_method(arg1 = :default, arg2 = nil, arg3 = [])
      # do something...
    end
    ```

    While several Ruby books suggest the first style, the second is much more prominent
    in practice (and arguably a bit more readable).

* Avoid line continuation (\\) where not required. In practice, avoid using
  line continuations at all.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = 1 - \
             2

    # good (but still ugly as hell)
    result = 1 \
             - 2
    ```

* Using the return value of `=` (an assignment) is ok, but surround the
  assignment with parenthesis.

    ```Ruby
    # good - shows intended use of assignment
    if ( v = array.grep( /foo/ ) ) ...

    # bad
    if v = array.grep(/foo/) ...

    # also good - shows intended use of assignment and has correct precedence.
    if (v = self.next_value) == 'hello' ...
    ```

* Use `||=` freely to initialize variables.

    ```Ruby
    # set name to Bozhidar, only if it's nil or false
    name ||= 'Bozhidar'
    ```

* Don't use `||=` to initialize boolean variables. (Consider what
would happen if the current value happened to be `false`.)

    ```Ruby
    # bad - would set enabled to true even if it was false
    enabled ||= true

    # good
    enabled = true if enabled.nil?
    ```

* Avoid using Perl-style special variables (like `$0-9`, `$``,
  etc. ). They are quite cryptic and their use in anything but
  one-liner scripts is discouraged.

* Never put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    f (3 + 2) + 1

    # good
    f( 3 + 2 ) + 1
    ```

* If the first argument to a method begins with an open parenthesis,
  always use parentheses in the method invocation. For example, write
`f((3 + 2) + 1)`.

* Always run the Ruby interpreter with the `-w` option so it will warn
you if you forget either of the rules above!

* When the keys of your hash are symbols use the Ruby 1.9 hash literal
syntax.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { :one => 1, :two => 2 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2 }
    ```

* Use the new lambda literal syntax.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    lambda = lambda { |a, b| a + b }
    lambda.call(1, 2)

    # good
    lambda = ->(a, b) { a + b }
    lambda.(1, 2)
    ```

* Use `_` for unused block parameters.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    result = hash.map { |k, v| v + 1 }

    # good
    result = hash.map { |_, v| v + 1 }
    ```

## Naming

> The only real difficulties in programming are cache invalidation and
> naming things. <br/>
> -- Phil Karlton

* Use `snake_case` for methods and variables.
* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules.  (Keep acronyms like HTTP,
  RFC, XML uppercase.)
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for other constants.
* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
  (i.e. `Array#empty?`).
* The names of potentially "dangerous" methods (i.e. methods that modify `self` or the
  arguments, `exit!` (doesn't run the finalizers like `exit` does), etc.) should end with an exclamation mark if
  there exists a safe version of that *dangerous* method.

    ```Ruby
    # bad - there is not matching 'safe' method
    class Person
      def update!
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      def update
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      def update!
      end

      def update
      end
    end
    ```

* Define the non-bang (safe) method in terms of the bang (dangerous)
  one if possible.

    ```Ruby
    class Array
      def flatten_once!
        res = []

        each do |e|
          [*e].each { |f| res << f }
        end

        replace(res)
      end

      def flatten_once
        dup.flatten_once!
      end
    end
    ```

* When using `reduce` with short blocks, name the arguments `|a, e|`
  (accumulator, element).
* When defining binary operators, name the argument `other`.

    ```Ruby
    def +(other)
      # body omitted
    end
    ```

* Prefer `map` over `collect`, `find` over `detect`, `select` over
  `find_all`, `reduce` over `inject` and `size` over `length`. This is
  not a hard requirement; if the use of the alias enhances
  readability, it's ok to use it. The rhyming methods are inherited from
  Smalltalk and are not common in other programming languages. The
  reason the use of `select` is encouraged over `find_all` is that it
  goes together nicely with `reject` and its name is pretty self-explanatory.

## Comments

> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a
> comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this
> comment isn't needed?" Improve the code and then document it to make
> it even clearer. <br/>
> -- Steve McConnell

* Write self-documenting code and ignore the rest of this section. Seriously!
* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation. Use [one
  space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) after periods.
* Avoid superfluous comments.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    counter += 1 # increments counter by one
    ```

* Keep existing comments up-to-date. An outdated is worse than no comment
at all.

> Good code is like a good joke - it needs no explanation. <br/>
> -- Russ Olsen

* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to
  make it self-explanatory. (Do or do not - there is no try. --Yoda)

## Annotations

* Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above
  the relevant code.
* The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.
* If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent
  lines should be indented two spaces after the `#`.

    ```Ruby
    def bar
      # FIXME: This has crashed occasionally since v3.2.1. It may
      #   be related to the BarBazUtil upgrade.
      baz(:quux)
    end
    ```

* In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would
  be redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line
  with no note. This usage should be the exception and not the rule.

    ```Ruby
    def bar
      sleep 100 # OPTIMIZE
    end
    ```

* Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be
  added at a later date.
* Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.
* Use `OPTIMIZE` to note slow or inefficient code that may cause
  performance problems.
* Use `HACK` to note code smells where questionable coding practices
  were used and should be refactored away.
* Use `REVIEW` to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it
  is working as intended. For example: `REVIEW: Are we sure this is how the
  client does X currently?`
* Use other custom annotation keywords if it feels appropriate, but be
  sure to document them in your project's `README` or similar.

## Classes

* When designing class hierarchies make sure that they conform to the
  [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).
* Try to make your classes as
  [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design\))
  as possible.
* Always supply a proper `to_s` method for classes that represent
  domain objects.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      def to_s
        "#@first_name #@last_name"
      end
    end
    ```

* Use the `attr` family of functions to define trivial accessors or
mutators.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class Person
      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      def first_name
        @first_name
      end

      def last_name
        @last_name
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end
    end
    ```
* Consider using `Struct.new`, which defines the trivial accessors,
constructor and comparison operators for you.

    ```Ruby
    # good
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end
    end

    # better
    class Person < Struct.new (:first_name, :last_name)
    end
    ````

* Consider adding factory methods to provide additional sensible ways
to create instances of a particular class.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      def self.create(options_hash)
        # body omitted
      end
    end
    ```

* Prefer [duck-typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) over inheritance.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class Animal
      # abstract method
      def speak
      end
    end

    # extend superclass
    class Duck < Animal
      def speak
        puts 'Quack! Quack'
      end
    end

    # extend superclass
    class Dog < Animal
      def speak
        puts 'Bau! Bau!'
      end
    end

    # good
    class Duck
      def speak
        puts 'Quack! Quack'
      end
    end

    class Dog
      def speak
        puts 'Bau! Bau!'
      end
    end
    ```

* Avoid the usage of class (`@@`) variables due to their "nasty" behavior
in inheritance.

    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      @@class_var = 'parent'

      def self.print_class_var
        puts @@class_var
      end
    end

    class Child < Parent
      @@class_var = 'child'
    end

    Parent.print_class_var # => will print "child"
    ```

    As you can see all the classes in a class hierarchy actually share one
    class variable. Class instance variables should usually be preferred
    over class variables.

* Assign proper visibility levels to methods (`private`, `protected`)
in accordance with their intended usage. Don't go off leaving
everything `public` (which is the default). After all we're coding
in *Ruby* now, not in *Python*.
* Indent the `public`, `protected`, and `private` methods as much the
  method definitions they apply to. Leave one blank line above them.

    ```Ruby
    class SomeClass
      def public_method
        # ...
      end

      private
      def private_method
        # ...
      end
    end

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods. This makes the methods
  more resistant to refactoring changes.

    ```Ruby
    class TestClass
      # bad
      def TestClass.some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # good
      def self.some_other_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # Also possible and convenient when you
      # have to define many singleton methods.
      class << self
        def first_method
          # body omitted
        end

        def second_method_etc
          # body omitted
        end
      end
    end
    ```

## Exceptions

* Signal exceptions using the `fail` keyword. Use `raise` only when
  catching an exception and re-raising it (because here you're not failing, but explicitly and purposefully raising an exception).

    ```Ruby
    begin
      fail 'Oops';
    rescue => error
      raise if error.message != 'Oops'
    end
    ```

* Never return form an `ensure` block. If you explicitly return from a
  method inside an `ensure` block, the return will take precedence over
  any exception being raised, and the method will return as if no
  exception had been raised at all. In effect, the exception will be
  silently thrown away.

    ```Ruby
    def foo
      begin
        fail
      ensure
        return 'very bad idea'
      end
    end
    ```

* Use *implicit begin blocks* when possible.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def foo
      begin
        # main logic goes here
      rescue
        # failure handling goes here
      end
    end

    # good
    def foo
      # main logic goes here
    rescue
      # failure handling goes here
    end
    ```

* Mitigate the proliferation of `begin` blocks via the use of
  *contingency methods* (a term coined by Avdi Grimm).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      something_that_might_fail
    rescue IOError
      # handle IOError
    end

    begin
      something_else_that_might_fail
    rescue IOError
      # handle IOError
    end

    # good
    def with_io_error_handling
       yield
    rescue
      # handle IOError
    end

    with_io_error_handling { something_that_might_fail }

    with_io_error_handling { something_else_that_might_fail }
    ```

* Don't suppress exceptions.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # an exception occurs here
    rescue SomeError
      # the rescue clause does absolutely nothing
    end

    # bad
    do_something rescue nil
    ```

* Don't use exceptions for flow of control.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      n / d
    rescue ZeroDivisionError
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    end

    # good
    if d.zero?
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    else
      n / d
    end
    ```

* Avoid rescuing the `Exception` class.  This will trap signals and calls to
  `exit`, requiring you to `kill -9` the process.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # calls to exit and kill signals will be caught (except kill -9)
      exit
    rescue Exception
      puts "you didn't really want to exit, right?"
      # exception handling
    end

    # good
    begin
      # a blind rescue rescues from StandardError, not Exception as many
      # programmers assume.
    rescue => e
      # exception handling
    end

    # also good
    begin
      # an exception occurs here

    rescue StandardError => e
      # exception handling
    end

    ```

* Put more specific exceptions higher up the rescue chain, otherwise
  they'll never be rescued from.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # some code
    rescue Exception => e
      # some handling
    rescue StandardError => e
      # some handling
    end

    # good
    begin
      # some code
    rescue StandardError => e
      # some handling
    rescue Exception => e
      # some handling
    end
    ```

* Release external resources obtained by your program in an ensure
block.

    ```Ruby
    f = File.open('testfile')
    begin
      # .. process
    rescue
      # .. handle error
    ensure
      f.close unless f.nil?
    end
    ```

* Favor the use of exceptions for the standard library over
introducing new exception classes.

## Collections

* Prefer literal array and hash creation notation (unless you need to
pass parameters to their constructors, that is).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    arr = Array.new
    hash = Hash.new

    # good
    arr = []
    hash = {}
    ```

* Prefer `%w` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of
strings.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    STATES = ['draft', 'open', 'closed']

    # good
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)
    ```

* Avoid the creation of huge gaps in arrays.

    ```Ruby
    arr = []
    arr[100] = 1 # now you have an array with lots of nils
    ```

* Use `Set` instead of `Array` when dealing with unique elements. `Set`
  implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates. This
  is a hybrid of `Array`'s intuitive inter-operation facilities and
  `Hash`'s fast lookup.
* Use symbols instead of strings as hash keys.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

* Avoid the use of mutable object as hash keys.
* Use the new 1.9 literal hash syntax in preference to the hashrocket
syntax.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { :one => 1, :two => 2, :three => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

* Rely on the fact that hashes in 1.9 are ordered.
* Never modify a collection while traversing it.

## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

    # good
    email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
    ```

* Consider padding string interpolation code with space. It more clearly sets the
  code apart from the string.

    ```Ruby
    "#{ user.last_name }, #{ user.first_name }"
    ```

* Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or
  special symbols such as `\t`, `\n`, `'`, etc.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    name = "Bozhidar"

    # good
    name = 'Bozhidar'
    ```

* Don't use `{}` around instance variables being interpolated into a
  string.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize( first_name, last_name )
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      # bad
      def to_s
        "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
      end

      # good
      def to_s
        "#@first_name #@last_name"
      end
    end
    ```

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
  Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
  and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string objects.

    ```Ruby
    # good and also fast
    html = ''
    html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

    paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
      html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
    end
    ```

## Regular Expressions

* Don't use regular expressions if you just need plain text search in string:
  `string['text']`
* For simple constructions you can use regexp directly through string index.

    ```Ruby
    match = string[/regexp/]             # get content of matched regexp
    first_group = string[/text(grp)/, 1] # get content of captured group
    string[/text (grp)/, 1] = 'replace'  # string => 'text replace'
    ```

* Use non capturing groups when you don't use captured result of parenthesis.

    ```Ruby
    /(first|second)/   # bad
    /(?:first|second)/ # good
    ```

* Avoid using $1-9 as it can be hard to track what they contain. Named groups
  can be used instead.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    /(regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process $1

    # good
    /(?<meaningful_var>regexp)/ =~ string
    ...
    process meaningful_var
    ```

* Character classes have only few special characters you should care about:
  `^`, `-`, `\`, `]`, so don't escape `.` or brackets in `[]`.

* Be careful with `^` and `$` as they match start/end of line, not string endings.
  If you want to match the whole string use: `\A` and `\z` (not to be
  confused with `\Z` which is the equivalent of `/\n?\z/`).

    ```Ruby
    string = "some injection\nusername"
    string[/^username$/]   # matches
    string[/\Ausername\z/] # don't match
    ```

* Use `x` modifier for complex regexps. This makes them more readable and you
  can add some useful comments. Just be careful as spaces are ignored.

    ```Ruby
    regexp = %r{
      start         # some text
      \s            # white space char
      (group)       # first group
      (?:alt1|alt2) # some alternation
      end
    }x
    ```

* For complex replacements `sub`/`gsub` can be used with block or hash.

## Percent Literals

* Use `%w` freely.

    ```Ruby
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)
    ```

* Use `%()` for single-line strings which require both interpolation
  and embedded double-quotes. For multi-line strings, prefer heredocs.

    ```Ruby
    # bad (no interpolation needed)
    %(<div class="text">Some text</div>)
    # should be '<div class="text">Some text</div>'

    # bad (no double-quotes)
    %(This is #{quality} style)
    # should be "This is #{quality} style"

    # bad (multiple lines)
    %(<div>\n<span class="big">#{exclamation}</span>\n</div>)
    # should be a heredoc.

    # good (requires interpolation, has quotes, single line)
    %(<tr><td class="name">#{name}</td>)
    ```

* Use `%r` only for regular expressions matching *more than* one '/' character.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    %r(\s+)

    # still bad
    %r(^/(.*)$)
    # should be /^\/(.*)$/

    # good
    %r(^/blog/2011/(.*)$)
    ```

* Avoid `%q`, `%Q`, `%x`, `%s`, and `%W`.

* Prefer `()` as delimiters for all `%` literals.

## Metaprogramming

* Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries. (Do not monkey
patch them.)

* The block form of `class_eval` is preferable to the string-interpolated form.
  - when you use the string-interpolated form, always supply `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`, so that your backtraces make sense:

    ```ruby
    class_eval 'def use_relative_model_naming?; true; end', __FILE__, __LINE__
    ```

  - `define_method` is preferable to `class_eval{ def ... }`

* When using `class_eval` (or other `eval`) with string interpolation, add a comment block showing its appearance if interpolated (a practice I learned from the rails code):

    ```ruby
    # from activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/output_safety.rb
    UNSAFE_STRING_METHODS.each do |unsafe_method|
      if 'String'.respond_to?(unsafe_method)
        class_eval <<-EOT, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
          def #{unsafe_method}(*args, &block)       # def capitalize(*args, &block)
            to_str.#{unsafe_method}(*args, &block)  #   to_str.capitalize(*args, &block)
          end                                       # end

          def #{unsafe_method}!(*args)              # def capitalize!(*args)
            @dirty = true                           #   @dirty = true
            super                                   #   super
          end                                       # end
        EOT
      end
    end
    ```

* avoid using `method_missing` for metaprogramming. Backtraces become messy; the behavior is not listed in `#methods`; misspelled method calls might silently work (`nukes.launch_state = false`). Consider using delegation, proxy, or `define_method` instead.  If you must, use `method_missing`,
  - be sure to [also define `respond_to_missing?`](http://blog.marc-andre.ca/2010/11/methodmissing-politely.html)
  - only catch methods with a well-defined prefix, such as `find_by_*` -- make your code as assertive as possible.
  - call `super` at the end of your statement
  - delegate to assertive, non-magical methods:

    ```ruby
    # bad
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        # ... lots of code to do a find_by
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # good
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        find_by(prop, *args, &block)
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # best of all, though, would to define_method as each findable attribute is declared
    ```

## Misc

* Write `ruby -w` safe code.
* Avoid hashes as optional parameters. Does the method do too much?
* Avoid methods longer than 10 LOC (lines of code). Ideally, most methods will be shorter than
  5 LOC. Empty lines do not contribute to the relevant LOC.
* Avoid parameter lists longer than three or four parameters.
* If you really have to, add "global" methods to Kernel and make them private.
* Use class instance variables instead of global variables.

    ```Ruby
    #bad
    $foo_bar = 1

    #good
    class Foo
      class << self
        attr_accessor :bar
      end
    end

    Foo.bar = 1
    ```

* Avoid `alias` when `alias_method` will do.
* Use `OptionParser` for parsing complex command line options and
`ruby -s` for trivial command line options.
* Code in a functional way, avoiding mutation when that makes sense.
* Avoid needless metaprogramming.
* Do not mutate arguments unless that is the purpose of the method.
* Avoid more than three levels of block nesting.
* Be consistent. In an ideal world, be consistent with these guidelines.
* Use common sense.


# Rails
# Developing Rails applications

## Configuration

* Put custom initialization code in `config/initializers`. The code in
  initializers executes on application startup.
* The initialization code for each gem should be in a separate file
  with the same name as the gem, for example `carrierwave.rb`,
  `active_admin.rb`, etc.
* Adjust accordingly the settings for development, test and production
  environment (in the corresponding files under `config/environments/`)
  * Mark additional assets for precompilation (if any):

        ```Ruby
        # config/environments/production.rb
        # Precompile additional assets (application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS are already added)
        config.assets.precompile += %w( rails_admin/rails_admin.css rails_admin/rails_admin.js )
        ```

* Create an additional `staging` environment that closely resembles
the `production` one.

## Routing

* When you need to add more actions to a RESTful resource (do you
  really need them at all?) use `member` and `collection` routes.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    get 'subscriptions/:id/unsubscribe'
    resources :subscriptions

    # good
    resources :subscriptions, :member => { :unsubscribe => :get }

    # bad
    get 'photos/search'
    resources :photos

    # good
    resources :photos,:collection => { :search => :get }
    ```

* Use nested routes to express better the relationship between
  ActiveRecord models.

    ```Ruby
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :comments
    end

    class Comments < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :post
    end

    # routes.rb
    resources :posts do
      resources :comments
    end
    ```

* Use namespaced routes to group related actions.

    ```Ruby
    namespace :admin do
      # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
      # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
      resources :products
    end
    ```

* Never use the legacy wild controller route. This route will make all
  actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.

    ```Ruby
    # very bad
    match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))'
    ```

## Controllers

* Keep the controllers skinny - they should only retrieve data for the
  view layer and shouldn't contain any business logic (all the
  business logic should naturally reside in the model).
* Each controller action should (ideally) invoke only one method other
  than an initial find or new.
* Share no more than two instance variables between a controller and a view.

## Models

* Introduce non-ActiveRecord model classes freely.
* Name the models with meaningful (but short) names without
abbreviations.
* If you need model objects that support ActiveRecord behavior like
  validation use the
  [ActiveAttr](https://github.com/cgriego/active_attr) gem.

    ```Ruby
    class Message
      include ActiveAttr::Model

      attribute :name
      attribute :email
      attribute :content
      attribute :priority

      attr_accessible :name, :email, :content

      validates_presence_of :name
      validates_format_of :email, :with => /^[-a-z0-9_+\.]+\@([-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z0-9]{2,4}$/i
      validates_length_of :content, :maximum => 500
    end
    ```

    For a more complete example refer to the
    [RailsCast on the subject](http://railscasts.com/episodes/326-activeattr).

### ActiveRecord

* Avoid altering ActiveRecord defaults (table names, primary key, etc)
  unless you have a very good reason (like a database that's not under
  your control).
* Group macro-style methods (`has_many`, `validates`, etc) in the
  beginning of the class definition.
* Prefer `has_many :through` to `has_and_belongs_to_many`. Using `has_many
:through` allows additional attributes and validations on the join model.

    ```Ruby
    # using has_and_belongs_to_many
    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_and_belongs_to_many :groups
    end

    class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_and_belongs_to_many :users
    end

    # prefered way - using has_many :through
    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :memberships
      has_many :groups, through: :memberships
    end

    class Membership < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :user
      belongs_to :group
    end

    class Group < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :memberships
      has_many :users, through: :memberships
    end
    ```

* When a custom validation is used more than once or the validation is some regular expression mapping,
create a custom validator file.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class Person
      validates :email, format: { with: /^([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})$/i }
    end

    # good
    class EmailValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
      def validate_each(record, attribute, value)
        record.errors[attribute] << (options[:message] || 'is not a valid email') unless value =~ /^([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})$/i
      end
    end

    class Person
      validates :email, email: true
    end
    ```

* All custom validators should be moved to a shared gem.
* Use named scopes freely.
* When a named scope, defined with a lambda and parameters, becomes too
complicated it is preferable to make a class method instead which serves
the same purpose of the named scope and returns and
`ActiveRecord::Relation` object.
* Beware of the behavior of the `update_attribute` method. It doesn't
  run the model validations (unlike `update_attributes`) and could easily corrupt the model state.
* Use user-friendly URLs. Show some descriptive attribute of the model in the URL rather than its `id`.
There is more than one way to achieve this:
  * Override the `to_param` method of the model. This method is used by Rails for constructing an URL to the object.
    The default implementation returns the `id` of the record as a String. It could be overridden to include another
    human-readable attribute.

        ```Ruby
        class Person
          def to_param
            "#{id} #{name}".parameterize
          end
        end
        ```
        In order to convert this to a URL-friendly value, `parameterize` should be called on the string. The `id` of the
        object needs to be at the beginning so that it could be found by the `find` method of ActiveRecord.

  * Use the `friendly_id` gem. It allows creation of human-readable URLs by using some descriptive attribute of the model instead of its `id`.

        ```Ruby
        class Person
          extend FriendlyId
          friendly_id :name, use: :slugged
        end
        ```

        Check the [gem documentation](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) for more information about its usage.

## Migrations

* Keep the `schema.rb` under version control.
* Use `rake db:schema:load` instead of `rake db:migrate` to initialize
an empty database.
* Use `rake db:test:prepare` to update the schema of the test database.
* Avoid setting defaults in the tables themselves. Use the model layer
  instead.

    ```Ruby
    def amount
      self[:amount] || 0
    end
    ```

    While the use of `self[:attr_name]` is considered fairly idiomatic,
    you might also consider using the slightly more verbose (and arguably more
    readable) `read_attribute` instead:

    ```Ruby
    def amount
      read_attribute( :amount ) || 0
    end
    ```

* When writing constructive migrations (adding tables or columns), ensure that the down mehtod is written
* When necessary, use execute("RAW SQL") to achieve missing functionality

## Views

* Never call the model layer directly from a view.
* Never make complex formatting in the views, export the formatting to
  a method in the view helper or the model.
* Mitigate code duplication by using partial templates and layouts.
* Add
  [client side validation](https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations)
  for the custom validators. The steps to do this are:
  * Declare a custom validator which extends `ClientSideValidations::Middleware::Base`

        ```Ruby
        module ClientSideValidations::Middleware
          class Email < Base
            def response
              if request.params[:email] =~ /^([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})$/i
                self.status = 200
              else
                self.status = 404
              end
              super
            end
          end
        end
        ```

  * Create a new file
    `public/javascripts/rails.validations.custom.js.coffee` and add a
    reference to it in your `application.js.coffee` file:

        ```Ruby
        # app/assets/javascripts/application.js.coffee
        #= require rails.validations.custom
        ```

  * Add your client-side validator:

        ```Ruby
        #public/javascripts/rails.validations.custom.js.coffee
        clientSideValidations.validators.remote['email'] = (element, options) ->
          if $.ajax({
            url: '/validators/email.json',
            data: { email: element.val() },
            async: false
          }).status == 404
            return options.message || 'invalid e-mail format'
        ```

## Internationalization

* No strings or other locale specific settings should be used in the views,
models and controllers. These texts should be moved to the locale files in
the `config/locales` directory.
* When the labels of an ActiveRecord model need to be translated,
use the `activerecord` scope:

    ```
    en:
      activerecord:
        models:
          user: Member
        attributes:
          user:
            name: "Full name"
    ```

    Then `User.model_name.human` will return "Member" and
    `User.human_attribute_name("name")` will return "Full name". These
    translations of the attributes will be used as labels in the views.

* Separate the texts used in the views from translations of ActiveRecord
attributes. Place the locale files for the models in a folder `models` and
the texts used in the views in folder `views`.
  * When organization of the locale files is done with additional
  directories, these directories must be described in the `application.rb`
  file in order to be loaded.

        ```Ruby
        # config/application.rb
        config.i18n.load_path += Dir[Rails.root.join('config', 'locales', '**', '*.{rb,yml}')]
        ```

* Place the shared localization options, such as date or currency formats, in
files
under
the root of the `locales` directory.
* Use the short form of the I18n methods: `I18n.t` instead of `I18n.translate`
and `I18n.l` instead of `I18n.localize`.
* Use "lazy" lookup for the texts used in views. Let's say we have the
following structure:

    ```
    en:
      users:
        show:
          title: "User details page"
    ```

    The value for `users.show.title` can be looked up in the template
    `app/views/users/show.html.haml` like this:

    ```Ruby
    = t '.title'
    ```

* Use the dot-separated keys in the controllers and models instead of
specifying the `:scope` option. The dot-separated call is easier to read and
trace the hierarchy.

    ```Ruby
    # use this call
    I18n.t 'activerecord.errors.messages.record_invalid'

    # instead of this
    I18n.t :record_invalid, :scope => [:activerecord, :errors, :messages]
    ```

* More detailed information about the Rails i18n can be found in the [Rails
Guides]
(http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html)

## Mailers

* Name the mailers `SomethingMailer`. Without the Mailer suffix it
  isn't immediately apparent what's a mailer and which views are
  related to the mailer.
* Provide both HTML and plain-text view templates.
* Enable errors raised on failed mail delivery in your development environment. The errors are disabled by default.

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb

    config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true
    ```

* Use `smtp.gmail.com` for SMTP server in the development environment
  (unless you have local SMTP server, of course).

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb

    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
      address: 'smtp.gmail.com',
      # more settings
    }
    ```

* Provide default settings for the host name.

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = {host: "#{local_ip}:3000"}


    # config/environments/production.rb
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = {host: 'your_site.com'}

    # in your mailer class
    default_url_options[:host] = 'your_site.com'
    ```

* If you need to use a link to your site in an email, always use the
  `_url`, not `_path` methods. The `_url` methods include the host
  name and the `_path` methods don't.

    ```Ruby
    # wrong
    You can always find more info about this course
    = link_to 'here', url_for(course_path(@course))

    # right
    You can always find more info about this course
    = link_to 'here', url_for(course_url(@course))
    ```

* Format the from and to addresses properly. Use the following format:

    ```Ruby
    # in your mailer class
    default from: 'Your Name <info@your_site.com>'
    ```

* Make sure that the e-mail delivery method for your test environment is set to `test`:

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/test.rb

    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test
    ```

* The delivery method for development and production should be `smtp`:

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb, config/environments/production.rb

    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
    ```

* When sending html emails all styles should be inline, as some mail clients
  have problems with external styles. This however makes them harder to
  maintain and leads to code duplication. There are two similar gems that
  transform the styles and put them in the corresponding html tags:
  [premailer-rails3](https://github.com/fphilipe/premailer-rails3) and
  [roadie](https://github.com/Mange/roadie).

* Sending emails while generating page response should be avoided. It causes
  delays in loading of the page and request can timeout if multiple email are
  send. To overcome this emails can be send in background process with the help
  of [delayed_job](https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job) gem.

## Bundler

* Put gems used only for development or testing in the appropriate group in the Gemfile.
* Use only established gems in your projects. If you're contemplating
on including some little-known gem you should do a careful review of
its source code first.
* OS-specific gems will by default result in a constantly changing `Gemfile.lock`
for projects with multiple developers using different operating systems.
Add all OS X specific gems to a `darwin` group in the Gemfile, and all Linux
specific gems to a `linux` group:

    ```Ruby
    # Gemfile
    group :darwin do
      gem 'rb-fsevent'
      gem 'growl'
    end

    group :linux do
      gem 'rb-inotify'
    end
    ```

    To require the appropriate gems in the right environment, add the
    following to `config/application.rb`:

    ```Ruby
    platform = RUBY_PLATFORM.match(/(linux|darwin)/)[0].to_sym
    Bundler.require(platform)
    ```

* Do not remove the `Gemfile.lock` from version control. This is not
  some randomly generated file - it makes sure that all of your team
  members get the same gem versions when they do a `bundle install`.

## Priceless Gems

One of the most important programming principles is "Don't reinvent
the wheel!". If you're faced with a certain task you should always
look around a bit for existing solutions, before unrolling your
own. Here's a list of some "priceless" gems :

* [active_admin](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin) - With ActiveAdmin
  the creation of admin interface for your Rails app is child's play. You get a
  nice dashboard, CRUD UI and lots more. Very flexible and customizable.
* [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) - Capybara aims to simplify
  the process of integration testing Rack applications, such as Rails, Sinatra
  or Merb. Capybara simulates how a real user would interact with a web
  application. It is agnostic about the driver running your tests and currently
  comes with Rack::Test and Selenium support built in. HtmlUnit, WebKit and
  env.js are supported through external gems. Works great in combination with
  RSpec & Cucumber.
* [carrierwave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) - the ultimate file
  upload solution for Rails. Support both local and cloud storage for the
  uploaded files (and many other cool things). Integrates great with
  ImageMagick for image post-processing.
* [client_side_validations](https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations) -
  Fantastic gem that automatically creates JavaScript client-side validations
  from your existing server-side model validations. Highly recommended!
* [compass-rails](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass) - Great gem that
  adds support for some css frameworks. Includes collection of sass mixins that
  reduces code of css files and help fight with browser incompatibilities.
* [cucumber-rails](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails) - Cucumber is
  the premium tool to develop feature tests in Ruby. cucumber-rails provides
  Rails integration for Cucumber.
* [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - Devise is full-featured
  authentication solution for Rails applications. In most cases it's preferable
  to use devise to unrolling your custom authentication solution.
* [fabrication](http://fabricationgem.org/) - a great fixture replacement
  (editor's choice).
* [factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) - an alternative
  to fabrication. Nice and mature fixture replacement. Spiritual ancestor of
  fabrication.
* [faker](http://faker.rubyforge.org/) - handy gem to generate dummy data
  (names, addresses, etc).
* [feedzirra](https://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra) - Very fast and flexible
  RSS/Atom feed parser.
* [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) - Allows creation of
  human-readable URLs by using some descriptive attribute of the model instead
  of its id.
* [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) - fantastic gem that monitors file
  changes and invokes tasks based on them. Loaded with lots of useful
  extension. Far superior to autotest and watchr.
* [haml-rails](https://github.com/indirect/haml-rails) - haml-rails provides
  Rails integration for Haml.
* [haml](http://haml-lang.com) - HAML is a concise templating language,
  considered by many (including yours truly) to be far superior to Erb.
* [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) - Great paginating solution.
* [machinist](https://github.com/notahat/machinist) - Fixtures aren't fun.
  Machinist is.
* [rspec-rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) - RSpec is a replacement
  for Test::MiniTest. I cannot recommend highly enough RSpec. rspec-rails
  provides Rails integration for RSpec.
* [simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) - once you've
  used simple_form (or formtastic) you'll never want to hear about Rails's
  default forms. It has a great DSL for building forms and no opinion on
  markup.
* [simplecov-rcov](https://github.com/fguillen/simplecov-rcov) - RCov formatter
  for SimpleCov. Useful if you're trying to use SimpleCov with the Hudson
  contininous integration server.
* [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) - code coverage tool.
  Unlike RCov it's fully compatible with Ruby 1.9. Generates great reports.
  Must have!
* [slim](http://slim-lang.com) - Slim is a concise templating language,
  considered by many far superior to HAML (not to mention Erb). The only thing
  stopping me from using Slim massively is the lack of good support in major
  editors/IDEs. Its performance is phenomenal.
* [spork](https://github.com/timcharper/spork) - A DRb server for testing
  frameworks (RSpec / Cucumber currently) that forks before each run to ensure
  a clean testing state. Simply put it preloads a lot of test environment and
  as consequence the startup time of your tests in greatly decreased. Absolute
  must have!
* [sunspot](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot) - SOLR powered full-text search
  engine.

This list is not exhaustive and other gems might be added to it along
the road. All of the gems on the list are field tested, have active
development and community and are known to be of good code quality.

## Flawed Gems

This is a list of gems that are either problematic or superseded by
other gems. You should avoid using them in your projects.

* [rmagick](http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/) - this gem is notorious for its memory consumption. Use
[minimagick](https://github.com/probablycorey/mini_magick) instead.
* [autotest](http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/) - old solution for running tests automatically. Far
inferior to guard and [watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr).
* [rcov](https://github.com/relevance/rcov) - code coverage tool, not
  compatible with Ruby 1.9. Use
  [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) instead.
* [therubyracer](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer) - the use of
  this gem in production is strongly discouraged as it uses a very large amount of
  memory. I'd suggest using
  [Mustang](https://github.com/nu7hatch/mustang) instead.

This list is also a work in progress. Please, let me know if you know
other popular, but flawed gems.

## Managing processes

* If your projects depends on various external processes use
  [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to manage them.

# Testing Rails applications

The best approach to implementing new features is probably the BDD
approach. You start out by writing some high level feature tests
(generally written using Cucumber), then you use these tests to drive
out the implementation of the feature. First you write view specs for
the feature and use those specs to create the relevant
views. Afterwards you create the specs for the controller(s) that will
be feeding data to the views and use those specs to implement the
controller. Finally you implement the models specs and the models
themselves.

## Cucumber

* Tag your pending scenarios with `@wip` (work in progress).  These
scenarios will not be taken into account and will not be marked as
failing.  When finishing the work on a pending scenario and
implementing the functionality it tests, the tag `@wip` should be
removed in order to include this scenario in the test suite.
* Setup your default profile to exclude the scenarios tagged with
`@javascript`.  They are testing using the browser and disabling them
is recommended to increase the regular scenarios execution speed.
* Setup a separate profile for the scenarios marked with `@javascript` tag.
  * The profiles can be configured in the `cucumber.yml` file.

        ```Ruby
        # definition of a profile:
        profile_name: --tags @tag_name
        ```

  * A profile is run with the command:

        ```
        cucumber -p profile_name
        ```

* If using [fabrication](http://fabricationgem.org/) for fixtures
  replacement, use the predefined
  [fabrication steps](http://fabricationgem.org/#!cucumber-steps)
* Do not use the old `web_steps.rb` step definitions!
[The web steps were removed from the latest version of Cucumber.](http://aslakhellesoy.com/post/11055981222/the-training-wheels-came-off) Their
usage leads to the creation of verbose scenarios that do not properly
reflect the application domain.
* When checking for the presence of an element with visible text
  (link, button, etc.) check for the text, not the element id. This
  can detect problems with the i18n.
* Create separate features for different functionality regarding the same kind of objects:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    Feature: Articles
    # ... feature  implementation ...

    # good
    Feature: Article Editing
    # ... feature  implementation ...

    Feature: Article Publishing
    # ... feature  implementation ...

    Feature: Article Search
    # ... feature  implementation ...

    ```

* Each feature has three main components
  * Title
  * Narrative - a short explanation what the feature is about.
  * Acceptance criteria - the set of scenarios each made up of individual steps.
* The most common format is known as the Connextra format.

    ```Ruby
    In order to [benefit] ...
    A [stakeholder]...
    Wants to [feature] ...
    ```

This format is the most common but is not required, the narrative can
be free text depending on the complexity of the feature.

* Use Scenario Outlines freely to keep the scenarios DRY.

    ```Ruby
    Scenario Outline: User cannot register with invalid e-mail
      When I try to register with an email "<email>"
      Then I should see the error message "<error>"

    Examples:
      |email         |error                 |
      |              |The e-mail is required|
      |invalid email |is not a valid e-mail |
    ```

* The steps for the scenarios are in `.rb` files under the
`step_definitions` directory. The naming convention for the steps file
is `[description]_steps.rb`.  The steps can be separated into
different files based on different criterias. It is possible to have
one steps file for each feature (`home_page_steps.rb`).  There also
can be one steps file for all features for a particular object
(`articles_steps.rb`).
* Use multiline step arguments to avoid repetition

    ```Ruby
    Scenario: User profile
      Given I am logged in as a user "John Doe" with an e-mail "user@test.com"
      When I go to my profile
      Then I should see the following information:
        |First name|John         |
        |Last name |Doe          |
        |E-mail    |user@test.com|

    # the step:
    Then /^I should see the following information:$/ do |table|
      table.raw.each do |field, value|
        find_field(field).value.should =~ /#{value}/
      end
    end
    ```

* Use compound steps to keep the scenario DRY

    ```Ruby
    # ...
    When I subscribe for news from the category "Technical News"
    # ...

    # the step:
    When /^I subscribe for news from the category "([^"]*)"$/ do |category|
      steps %Q{
        When I go to the news categories page
        And I select the category #{category}
        And I click the button "Subscribe for this category"
        And I confirm the subscription
      }
    end
    ```
* Always use the Capybara negative matchers instead of should_not with positive,
they will retry the match for given timeout allowing you to test ajax actions.
[See Capybara's README for more explanation](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara)

## RSpec

* Use just one expectation per example.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    describe ArticlesController do
      #...

      describe 'GET new' do
        it 'assigns new article and renders the new article template' do
          get :new
          assigns[:article].should be_a_new Article
          response.should render_template :new
        end
      end

      # ...
    end

    # good
    describe ArticlesController do
      #...

      describe 'GET new' do
        it 'assigns a new article' do
          get :new
          assigns[:article].should be_a_new Article
        end

        it 'renders the new article template' do
          get :new
          response.should render_template :new
        end
      end

    end
    ```

* Make heavy use of `describe` and `context`
* Name the `describe` blocks as follows:
  * use "description" for non-methods
  * use pound "#method" for instance methods
  * use dot ".method" for class methods

    ```Ruby
    class Article
      def summary
        #...
      end

      def self.latest
        #...
      end
    end

    # the spec...
    describe Article
      describe '#summary'
        #...
      end

      describe '.latest'
        #...
      end
    end
    ```

* Use [fabricators](http://fabricationgem.org/) to create test
  objects.
* Make heavy use of mocks and stubs

    ```Ruby
    # mocking a model
    article = mock_model(Article)

    # stubbing a method
    Article.stub(:find).with(article.id).and_return(article)
    ```

* When mocking a model, use the `as_null_object` method. It tells the
  output to listen only for messages we expect and ignore any other
  messages.

    ```Ruby
    article = mock_model(Article).as_null_object
    ```

* Use `let` blocks instead of `before(:all)` blocks to create data for
  the spec examples. `let` blocks get lazily evaluated.

    ```Ruby
    # use this:
    let(:article) { Fabricate(:article) }

    # ... instead of this:
    before(:each) { @article = Fabricate(:article) }
    ```

* Use `subject` when possible

    ```Ruby
    describe Article do
      subject { Fabricate(:article) }

      it 'is not published on creation' do
        subject.should_not be_published
      end
    end
    ```

* Use `specify` if possible. It is a synonym of `it` but is more readable when there is no docstring.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    describe Article do
      before { @article = Fabricate(:article) }

      it 'is not published on creation' do
        @article.should_not be_published
      end
    end

    # good
    describe Article do
      let(:article) { Fabricate(:article) }
      specify { article.should_not be_published }
    end
    ```

* Use `its` when possible

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    describe Article do
      subject { Fabricate(:article) }

      it 'has the current date as creation date' do
        subject.creation_date.should == Date.today
      end
    end

    # good
    describe Article do
      subject { Fabricate(:article) }
      its(:creation_date) { should == Date.today }
    end
    ```

### Views

* The directory structure of the view specs `spec/views` matches the
  one in `app/views`. For example the specs for the views in
  `app/views/users` are placed in `spec/views/users`.
* The naming convention for the view specs is adding `_spec.rb` to the
  view name, for example the view `_form.html.haml` has a
  corresponding spec `_form.html.haml_spec.rb`.
* `spec_helper.rb` need to be required in each view spec file.
* The outer `describe` block uses the path to the view without the
  `app/views` part. This is used by the `render` method when it is
  called without arguments.

    ```Ruby
    # spec/views/articles/new.html.haml_spec.rb
    require 'spec_helper'

    describe 'articles/new.html.haml' do
      # ...
    end
    ```

* Always mock the models in the view specs. The purpose of the view is
  only to display information.
* The method `assign` supplies the instance variables which the view
  uses and are supplied by the controller.

    ```Ruby
    # spec/views/articles/edit.html.haml_spec.rb
    describe 'articles/edit.html.haml' do
    it 'renders the form for a new article creation' do
      assign(
        :article,
        mock_model(Article).as_new_record.as_null_object
      )
      render
      rendered.should have_selector('form',
        method: 'post',
        action: articles_path
      ) do |form|
        form.should have_selector('input', type: 'submit')
      end
    end
    ```

* Prefer the capybara negative selectors over should_not with the positive.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    page.should_not have_selector('input', type: 'submit')
    page.should_not have_xpath('tr')

    # good
    page.should have_no_selector('input', type: 'submit')
    page.should have_no_xpath('tr')
    ```

* When a view uses helper methods, these methods need to be
  stubbed. Stubbing the helper methods is done on the `template`
  object:

    ```Ruby
    # app/helpers/articles_helper.rb
    class ArticlesHelper
      def formatted_date(date)
        # ...
      end
    end

    # app/views/articles/show.html.haml
    = "Published at: #{formatted_date(@article.published_at)}"

    # spec/views/articles/show.html.haml_spec.rb
    describe 'articles/show.html.html' do
      it 'displays the formatted date of article publishing'
        article = mock_model(Article, published_at: Date.new(2012, 01, 01))
        assign(:article, article)

        template.stub(:formatted_date).with(article.published_at).and_return '01.01.2012'

        render
        rendered.should have_content('Published at: 01.01.2012')
      end
    end
    ```

* The helpers specs are separated from the view specs in the `spec/helpers` directory.

### Controllers

* Mock the models and stub their methods. Testing the controller should not depend on the model creation.
* Test only the behaviour the controller should be responsible about:
  * Execution of particular methods
  * Data returned from the action - assigns, etc.
  * Result from the action - template render, redirect, etc.

        ```Ruby
        # Example of a commonly used controller spec
        # spec/controllers/articles_controller_spec.rb
        # We are interested only in the actions the controller should perform
        # So we are mocking the model creation and stubbing its methods
        # And we concentrate only on the things the controller should do

        describe ArticlesController do
          # The model will be used in the specs for all methods of the controller
          let(:article) { mock_model(Article) }

          describe 'POST create' do
            before { Article.stub(:new).and_return(article) }

            it 'creates a new article with the given attributes' do
              Article.should_receive(:new).with(title: 'The New Article Title').and_return(article)
              post :create, message: { title: 'The New Article Title' }
            end

            it 'saves the article' do
              article.should_receive(:save)
              post :create
            end

            it 'redirects to the Articles index' do
              article.stub(:save)
              post :create
              response.should redirect_to(action: 'index')
            end
          end
        end
        ```

* Use context when the controller action has different behaviour depending on the received params.

    ```Ruby
    # A classic example for use of contexts in a controller spec is creation or update when the object saves successfully or not.

    describe ArticlesController do
      let(:article) { mock_model(Article) }

      describe 'POST create' do
        before { Article.stub(:new).and_return(article) }

        it 'creates a new article with the given attributes' do
          Article.should_receive(:new).with(title: 'The New Article Title').and_return(article)
          post :create, article: { title: 'The New Article Title' }
        end

        it 'saves the article' do
          article.should_receive(:save)
          post :create
        end

        context 'when the article saves successfully' do
          before { article.stub(:save).and_return(true) }

          it 'sets a flash[:notice] message' do
            post :create
            flash[:notice].should eq('The article was saved successfully.')
          end

          it 'redirects to the Articles index' do
            post :create
            response.should redirect_to(action: 'index')
          end
        end

        context 'when the article fails to save' do
          before { article.stub(:save).and_return(false) }

          it 'assigns @article' do
            post :create
            assigns[:article].should be_eql(article)
          end

          it 're-renders the "new" template' do
            post :create
            response.should render_template('new')
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```

### Models

* Do not mock the models in their own specs.
* Use fabrication to make real objects.
* It is acceptable to mock other models or child objects.
* Create the model for all examples in the spec to avoid duplication.

    ```Ruby
    describe Article
      let(:article) { Fabricate(:article) }
    end
    ```

* Add an example ensuring that the fabricated model is valid.

    ```Ruby
    describe Article
      it 'is valid with valid attributes' do
        article.should be_valid
      end
    end
    ```

* When testing validations, use `have(x).errors_on` to specify the attibute
which should be validated. Using `be_valid` does not guarantee that the problem
 is in the intended attribute.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    describe '#title'
      it 'is required' do
        article.title = nil
        article.should_not be_valid
      end
    end

    # prefered
    describe '#title'
      it 'is required' do
        article.title = nil
        article.should have(1).error_on(:title)
      end
    end
    ```

* Add a separate `describe` for each attribute which has validations.

    ```Ruby
    describe Article
      describe '#title'
        it 'is required' do
          article.title = nil
          article.should have(1).error_on(:title)
        end
      end
    end
    ```

* When testing uniqueness of a model attribute, name the other object `another_object`.

    ```Ruby
    describe Article
      describe '#title'
        it 'is unique' do
          another_article = Fabricate.build(:article, title: article.title)
          article.should have(1).error_on(:title)
        end
      end
    end
    ```

### Mailers

* The model in the mailer spec should be mocked. The mailer should not depend on the model creation.
* The mailer spec should verify that:
  * the subject is correct
  * the receiver e-mail is correct
  * the e-mail is sent to the right e-mail address
  * the e-mail contains the required information

     ```Ruby
     describe SubscriberMailer
       let(:subscriber) { mock_model(Subscription, email: 'johndoe@test.com', name: 'John Doe') }

       describe 'successful registration email'
         subject { SubscriptionMailer.successful_registration_email(subscriber) }

         its(:subject) { should == 'Successful Registration!' }
         its(:from) { should == ['info@your_site.com'] }
         its(:to) { should == [subscriber.email] }

         it 'contains the subscriber name' do
           subject.body.encoded.should match(subscriber.name)
         end
       end
     end
     ```

### Uploaders

* What we can test about an uploader is whether the images are resized correctly.
Here is a sample spec of a [carrierwave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) image uploader:

    ```Ruby

    # rspec/uploaders/person_avatar_uploader_spec.rb
    require 'spec_helper'
    require 'carrierwave/test/matchers'

    describe PersonAvatarUploader do
      include CarrierWave::Test::Matchers

      # Enable images processing before executing the examples
      before(:all) do
        UserAvatarUploader.enable_processing = true
      end

      # Create a new uploader. The model is mocked as the uploading and resizing images does not depend on the model creation.
      before(:each) do
        @uploader = PersonAvatarUploader.new(mock_model(Person).as_null_object)
        @uploader.store!(File.open(path_to_file))
      end

      # Disable images processing after executing the examples
      after(:all) do
        UserAvatarUploader.enable_processing = false
      end

      # Testing whether image is no larger than given dimensions
      context 'the default version' do
        it 'scales down an image to be no larger than 256 by 256 pixels' do
          @uploader.should be_no_larger_than(256, 256)
        end
      end

      # Testing whether image has the exact dimensions
      context 'the thumb version' do
        it 'scales down an image to be exactly 64 by 64 pixels' do
          @uploader.thumb.should have_dimensions(64, 64)
        end
      end
    end

    ```
